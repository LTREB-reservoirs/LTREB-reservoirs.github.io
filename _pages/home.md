Welcome to the Virginia Reservoirs Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) program! Our LTREB has two major activities: 

1) We lead a long-term, state-of-the-art ecosystem monitoring and data-publishing program focused on two Virginia reservoirs; and
  
2) We run VERA (the Virginia Ecoforecast Reservoir Analysis), an open forecasting challenge to predict a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables at the reservoirs before the data are collected.

The overarching goals of our interdisciplinary team are to innovate ecosystem monitoring, data publishing, and forecasting _and_ improve water management and education. We are guided by our values of collaboration, open science, and innovation, and invite you to explore our datasets and submit forecasts to the VERA Challenge!
