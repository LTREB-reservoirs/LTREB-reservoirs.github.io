Welcome to the Virginia Reservoirs Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) program! Our LTREB program has two major activities: 

1) We lead long-term, state-of-the art ecosystem monitoring of two Virginia reservoirs
  
2) We run the VERA (Virginia Ecoforecast Reservoir Analysis), an open forecasting challenge to predict a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables at the reservoirs before the data are collected.

The overarching goals of our interdisciplinary team are to both innovate ecosystem monitoring, data publishing, and forecasting _and_ improve water management and education. We are guided by our values of collaboration, open science, and innovation, and invite you to explore our datasets and submit forecasts to the VERA Challenge!
